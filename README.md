## How this game works:
1. We can guess the number behind the “?” by writing the number in the guess box and clicking check,
2. If our guess number is lower than the secret number, we will get the message “Too low” and our score will increase,
3. If our guess number is higher than the secret number, we will get the message “Too high” and our score will increase,
4. If our guess number is true, same as the secret number, then the layer will change color become green, the secret number will appear, the message is “You win”,
5. If our score is high than before, we will get the high score saved below the score,
6. We can try again the game byclickingk the again button.
